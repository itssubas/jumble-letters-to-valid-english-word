# Jumbled letters to valid english words generator

This is a simple python program that generates possible valid english words from the same letters. Which may be in different order.



### Illustration

If 'rea' is provided as input, the output will be

```
['rea', 'rae', 'era', 'ear', 'are', 'aer']
era
ear
are
3
```
Which means that there are six total permutations of the three letters 'rea' and among them, only three words are valid english words [era, ear, are]
